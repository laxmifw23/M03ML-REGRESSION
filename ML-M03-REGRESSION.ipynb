It aims to create a linear equation that best predicts the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable. The equation takes the form of Y = β0 + β1X + ε, where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, β0 is the intercept, β1 is the slope, and ε is the error term."
